        <h1>Watched Ecilipse at a Cold Night</h1>
        <p>Tonight there is a full ecilipse. Susie and I did not make big plan for it.</p>
        <p>At the beginning we just watched by naked eyes, and tried to take pictures using our mobile phone. Of course our pictures are low-quality. On the
            social media and chat groups, people are posting their blur pictures. It was fun to compare and find which one is worse.</p>
        <p>Then I sunddently remembered my friends gave me a high quality binoculars before. It did not take me too long
            to find it from the storage room.</p>

        <p>Through the telescope, the moon is much more clear and even more beautiful.</p>
        <p>I wanted to share my beautiful view to my social media as well. I did not know if I can but I definetely
            wanted to take pictures through the telescope</p>
        <p>It turned to be very hard. We need to aim the telescope right to the moon, and hold both the telescope and
            the camera very stable. We do not have a tripod. Susie and I just used our bare hands, and we worked
            together, in some awkward gestures. But we made it!</p>
