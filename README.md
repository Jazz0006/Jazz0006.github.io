## About this website

The T1A2 assignment of CCC course is to build our portfolio website. This is a good chance to practise my HTML and CSS knowledge (Javascript is not recommended at this time.)

It is also a good platform to display my experience, knowledge, projects I have been working on, my interests and other personal information. I will keep improving my site and use it as a showcase of myself in the future.

I took reference of many example protfolio websites but manually typed in each line of codes in this website. I found this helped greatly in my understanding of CSS, to observe how each setting in CSS renders different result, and the interactive effect of codes in parent-child and peer elements.
