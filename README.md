## About this website

The T1A2 assignment of CCC course is to build our portfolio website. This is a practise my HTML and CSS knowledge (Javascript is not recommended at this time.)

It is also a good platform to display my experience, knowledge, projects, interests and other personal information.

I took reference of example protfolio website but manually typed in each line of codes in this website. It is really helpful to check out how each setting in CSS renders different result, and the interactive effect of settings in parent-child and peer elements.
